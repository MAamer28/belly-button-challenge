# Belly Button Challenge
Module 14 

## Background
In this assignment, we will build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Data Analysis
Below is a screenshot of the HTML dashboard, created  via JavaScript. The image shows the OTU data for sample 941.
